#  Inappropriate Drone Recordings
This is a very simple mod to make sure that the drone will not be monitored by the game and stop recording based on actions of the sims. If a sim gets reset to play an animation the drone will reset and stop recording.

Sims can now record themselves or their their neighbour sims nude, taking a shower or in bed. Recording sims while an animation is playing is not possible.

This mod requires S4CL.

History:
The mod is based on the work of 'CloudyWeather331' which has been released here: https://modthesims.info/d/633784/ and is unfortunately no longer supported.

Have fun extending this mod and/or integrating it within your mod.
